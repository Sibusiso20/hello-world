# hello-world
Let's get started with GitHub!

Today is November 18, 2019. I just found out about five hours ago that I have a Java programming exam on Saturday. Come to think of it, I was supposed to be in Philadelphia this weekend for the Philly Marathon. What would I have done, after buying tickets and all that? Was I going to fly after my exam? I just did the Charlotte marathon last Saturday, and today I got back my project 2, java results. I think running, or rather, overdoing running is impacting my study time. I need to balance my extra curricular activities a little bit better.
